In almost every game you need to know this... when two gameobjects touch! So in this unity tutorial Im just going to go over the collision and trigger basics I've encountered. For each there are three types of events: enter, stay, exit.  And the rules are that each gameobject must have a collider and at least one object must have a Rigidbody. We will even go into collisions of child objects. In some cases they will pass the collision event up to the parent -and- in some cases not. But we can overcome that with a script and do it manually.
